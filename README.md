# Computer Vison - Brain Tumor Classification - By David Salako.

## Context

Brain tumor is known to be one of the most aggressive diseases that affect both children and adults. Of all primary Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors, brain tumors account for 85 to 90 percent. Around 11,700 individuals are diagnosed with a brain tumor every year. For individuals with a cancerous brain or CNS tumor, the 5-year survival rate is around 34 percent for men and 36 percent for women. Brain tumors are classified into Benign Tumors, Pituitary Tumors, Malignant Tumors etc. In order to increase the life expectancy of patients, adequate care, preparation and reliable diagnostics are required in the treatment process.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the best way to identify brain tumors. A huge amount of image data is produced through MRI Scans. However, there are several anomalies in the tumor size and location (s). This makes it very difficult to completely comprehend the nature of the tumor. A trained neurosurgeon is usually needed for MRI image analysis. The lack of qualified doctors and the lack of knowledge about tumors makes it very difficult and time-consuming for clinical facilities in developing countries to perform MRI studies. Due to the level of difficulty involved in comprehending the nature of brain tumors and their properties, manual analyses can be highly error-prone. That makes an automated MRI analysis system crucial to solve this problem.

Applications of automated classification techniques using Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms have consistently shown better performance than manual classification. It would therefore be highly beneficial to write an algorithm that performs detection and classification of brain tumors using Deep Learning Algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset folder contains MRI data. The images are already split into Training and Testing folders. Each folder has more four subfolders named "glioma_tumor", "meningioma_tumor", "no_tumor" and "pituitary_tumor". These folders have MRI images of the respective tumor classes.
